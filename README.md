- :dog: Welcome to the GitHub repo of @rigratz. I don't bite.
- :mage: Iâ€™m into all sorts of nerd stuff. Most of my personal projects revolve around games in one way or another. Often they will be made using a language I'm unfamiliar with, as a way to get out of my comfort zone and learn something new.
- ðŸ“« I try to avoid e-mail, but if you must I can be reached at riley.gratzer@gmail.com or babaogratzer@gmail.com
